    <h2>Draw by Typing.</h2>
    <img scr="butterfly.jpg" height="300" width="250">
    <p style="background-color:White;font-family:'Courier New'"><font size=4>In this project, my group and I decided to make a customizable, interactive drawing program that allowed the user to choose different things to draw and the colors with which to fill it in. The options were a butterfly, apple, snowman, or car, and each option allowed the user to choose three colors. The color options were red, pink, purple, green, blue, black, and gray. Once the user inputted their drawing and color choice and pressed enter, the program would create their personal drawing and add a moving sun in the background.</font></p>

    <h2>WordSmith.</h2>
    <img scr="wordgame.jpg" height="300" width="250">
    <p style="background-color:White;font-family:'Courier New'"><font size=4>This game allows the player to type the words that appear on the screen in the clouds, which causes them to drop and create a score at the top of the page. The words change randomly from the table we created, and there is no time limit for typing the words out. Once the three words on the screen fall, three new ones appear, and the game continues.</font></p>
